## Overview 

The Vault Filter is a utility script intended for use with obsidian vaults that have tags.  It works by detecting and removing files which do not fit the criteria.  

You will need to manually edit the filter_profiles.json

### How to use?

1. Open your terminal app.
2. Navigate to the directory containing 'vault.py'
3. Place your vault file path and filename in the 'config.md' file until the file_path and file_name options.
4. filter_profiles.json has example profiles, configure the json as you need to.  I recommend a site such as https://jsonlint.com/ for editing JSON files.
5. 

### Dev: Prerequisites
